# mini_talk
A small data exchange program in the form of a client and a server using only UNIX signals. The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server. Once the string has been received by the client , the server must print it pretty quickly. Only two signals are allowed: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
